You know, I could just feel his rotting hand on my shoulder here, and his ghastly breath on my neck." L.D.W.'s success with this free throw can be attributed to error in natural law or some connection to the Church, as it is unlikely he is capable of making a free throw successfully without intervention.`

I, personally, checked with the interns and they agreed that if he could overcome the frailty of mind that has haunted him throughout his life, L.D.W. could become an exceptional NBA point guard known for sinking threes. However, I fear sometimes that the interns only agree with me for fear of some unspecified retribution which I would deliver from my position of authority like that wrathful God who so inflicted the Ten Plagues upon the ancient peoples of Egypt...`
